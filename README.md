# LA COMPTA SERVER

<p style="text-align: justify">
A Node js Rest Api that will help “le petit marche” to manage his finances with effectiveness and transparency. It will be developed following the Ohada accounting standard. It will be sectioned in two, one section for a non-accountants user and the other section for accountants. And all endpoints will require authentication.
